# Scholar

Scholar is a Chrome extension designed to empower users by enhancing their research and writing processes. This extension, appearing as a discreet right-hand side panel, integrates information directly from the web pages being viewed and any documents provided by the user.

The core mission of Scholar is to enhance user activity on the internet. Unlike ChatGPT, which can generate content from scratch, our extension aims to refine and elevate users' existing writing. We focus on amplifying the user's original voice and intention, providing advice that boosts the text's clarity and style without overshadowing the user's unique expression. Our goal is to alleviate the anxiety associated with research and writing tasks, fostering a more enjoyable and productive journey.

## Advisory, Not Authorial

Scholar differentiates itself by offering guidance to enhance users' existing writing rather than authoring content on their behalf. This approach ensures that while the quality of text is improved, the integrity and originality of the user's voice are preserved.
